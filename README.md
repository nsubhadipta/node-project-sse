# Server Sent Events (SSE)
Send data to the clients in real time with SSE technology

## An simple example showing how to user server sent events with node.js

> Server Sent Events are a good option instead WebSockets when you just need one-way data flow (server to client)
> They are based in Http protocol and are much simplier than WebSockets Protocol.

### So, Let's get started!

1. Don't forget to run `npm install` before launch this project.
2. Launch the server typing `npm run start`
3. Open your browser and call `localhost:8080` to see the magic!

# Congratulations
